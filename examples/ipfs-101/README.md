## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.

### Installation and Running example

```console
> npm install
> npm start
```

## Usage

In this tutorial, we go through spawning a Helia node, adding a file and cat'ing the file [CID][] locally and through the gateway.

You can find a complete version of this tutorial in [index.js](./index.js). For this tutorial, you need to install all dependencies in the `package.json` using `npm install`.

### Code analysis

#### Blockstore

At it's heart the Interplanetary Filesystem is about blocks.  When you add a file to your local Helia node, it is split up into a number of blocks, all of which are stored in a [blockstore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/interface-blockstore).

Each block has a [CID][], an identifier that is unique to that block and can be used to request it from other nodes in the network.

A blockstore is a key/value store where the keys are [CID][]s and the values are [Uint8Array][]s.

By default we're going to use an in-memory blockstore, though later you may wish to use one that stores blocks on a filesystem.

```js
import { MemoryBlockstore } from 'blockstore-core'

const blockstore = new MemoryBlockstore()
```

#### Datastore

Some facility to store information is required, this needs a [datastore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/interface-datastore).

Similar to the blockstore, a datastore is a key/value store where the keys are strings and the values are [Uint8Array][]s.

```js
import { MemoryDatastore } from 'datastore-core'

const datastore = new MemoryDatastore()
```

#### libp2p

[libp2p][] is the networking layer that IPFS works on top of.  It is a modular system, comprising of transports, connection encrypters, stream multiplexers, etc.

```js
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { noise } from '@chainsafe/libp2p-noise'
import { yamux } from '@chainsafe/libp2p-yamux'
import { webSockets } from '@libp2p/websockets'
import { bootstrap } from '@libp2p/bootstrap'
import { MemoryDatastore } from 'datastore-core'

const datastore = new MemoryDatastore()

const libp2p = await createLibp2p({
  datastore,
  transports: [
    webSockets()
  ],
  connectionEncryption: [
    noise()
  ],
  streamMuxers: [
    yamux()
  ],
  peerDiscovery: [
    bootstrap({
      list: [
        "/dnsaddr/bootstrap.libp2p.io/p2p/QmNnooDu7bfjPFoTZYxMNLWUQJyrVwtbZg5gBMjTezGAJN",
        "/dnsaddr/bootstrap.libp2p.io/p2p/QmQCU2EcMqAqQPR2i9bChDtGNJchTbq5TbXJJ16u19uLTa",
        "/dnsaddr/bootstrap.libp2p.io/p2p/QmbLHAnMoJPWSCR5Zhtx6BHJX9KiKNN6tpvbUcqanj75Nb",
        "/dnsaddr/bootstrap.libp2p.io/p2p/QmcZf59bWwK5XFi76CZX8cbJ4BhTzzA3gU1ZjYZcYW3dwt"
      ]
    })
  ]
})
```

#### Helia

Now we have the components we need, we can create our Helia instance and print out some information about the node:

```js
import { createHelia } from 'helia'

const helia = await createHelia({
  libp2p,
  datastore,
  blockstore
})

const info = await helia.info()

console.info(info.peerId)
```

#### Putting it all together

Running the code above gets you:

```console
> node index.js
PeerId(12D3KooW...)
```

#### File systems

Blocks are all good and well, but to really get moving we need a filesystem.  Add the `@helia/unixfs` dependency to your project, create an instance and add some data:

```js
import { unixfs } from '@helia/unixfs`

// create an UnixFS instance by passing the Helia node to the factory function
const fs = unixfs(helia)

// we will use the `TextEncoder` to turn a string into a Uint8Array
const encoder = new TextEncoder()

// add the bytes to your Helia node and receive a CID
const cid = await fs.add(encoder.encode('Hello World 101'))

// let's see what it looks like
console.log('Added file:', cid)
```

You can now go to an IPFS Gateway and load the printed hash from a gateway. Go ahead and try it!

```bash
> node 1.js
Version: 0.31.2

Added file: bafkreife2klsil6kaxqhvmhgldpsvk5yutzm4i5bgjoq6fydefwtihnesa
# Copy that hash and load it on the gateway, here is a prefiled url:
# https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreife2klsil6kaxqhvmhgldpsvk5yutzm4i5bgjoq6fydefwtihnesa
```

The last step of this tutorial is retrieving the file back using the `cat` ðŸ˜º call.

```js
const decoder = new TextDecoder()
let text = ''

for await (const chunk of fs.cat(cid)) {
  text += decoder.decode(chunk, {
    stream: true
  })
}

console.log('Added file contents:', text)
```

That's it! You just added and retrieved a file from the Distributed Web!
