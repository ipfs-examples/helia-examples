## About The Project

- Read the [docs](https://ipfs.github.io/helia/modules/helia.html)
- Look into other [examples](https://github.com/ipfs-examples/helia-examples) to learn how to spawn a Helia node in Node.js and in the Browser
- Visit https://dweb-primer.ipfs.io to learn about IPFS and the concepts that underpin it
- Head over to https://proto.school to take interactive tutorials that cover core IPFS APIs
- Check out https://docs.ipfs.io for tips, how-tos and more
- See https://blog.ipfs.io for news and more
- Need help? Please ask 'How do I?' questions on https://discuss.ipfs.io

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.

### Installation and Running example

```console
> npm install
> npm start
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:8888.

## Usage

This example is basic demo and proof of concept for using helia via script tags. Other examples use build-scripts that may be too complicated for your needs. If you have a website where you manage your dependencies via script tags in an HTML file, you may benefit from looking at this example instead of the others at https://github.com/ipfs-examples/helia-examples/tree/main/examples.

If you are seeing errors like `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` or `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` when trying to use this example, please check out `/examples/helia-cjs` instead.

The main areas of focus should be two files: `index.html` and `src/index.js`.

If you're confused about what the different methods under 'Some Suggestions' are doing, you may want to check out [helia-101](https://github.com/ipfs-examples/helia-101) for a full breakdown of the code.

### Using the example

The page you will see is broken up into 4 sections:

1. The intro: title and global variables you can play with in your browser console
2. Node Status: The status of the helia node, which is updated every 500ms
   * Helia will start up on page load. You can use the 'Start Helia' and 'Stop Helia' to call `helia.start()` and `helia.stop()` respectively.
   * Updated content (look for `nodeUpdateInterval = ` in `src/index.js` to change or edit what's updated):
      * Node Status - shows either "Online" or "Offline".
      * ID - Shows the PeerId of your Helia node.
      * Discovered Peers - The count of peers discovered. Check the event log at the bottom of the page to see their IDs.
      * Connected Peers - The count of peers your helia node is connected to. Also, a list of their `PeerId`s will render if the count is > 0.
3. Suggestions: Try out these code snippets in your browser terminal, in order.
4. Event Log: Elapsed-TimeStamped messages showing you some of what Helia and it's managed libp2p node are doing. This event log shows:
   * instantiation of the libp2p instance passed to helia
   * instantiation of the Helia node
   * peer discovery
   * peer connection
   * peer disconnection

The IPFS implementation in JavaScript needs your help! There are a few things you can do right now to help out:

Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and [JavaScript Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_JS.md).

- **Check out existing issues** The [issue list](https://github.com/ipfs/helia/issues) has many that are marked as ['help wanted'](https://github.com/ipfs/helia/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or ['difficulty:easy'](https://github.com/ipfs/helia/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Adifficulty%3Aeasy) which make great starting points for development, many of which can be tackled with no prior IPFS knowledge
- **Look at the [Helia Roadmap](https://github.com/ipfs/helia/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)** This are the high priority items being worked on right now
- **Perform code reviews** More eyes will help
  a. speed the project along
  b. ensure quality, and
  c. reduce possible future bugs
- **Add tests**. There can never be enough tests
