## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

https://github.com/ipfs-examples/helia-examples#prerequisites

### Installation and Running example

```console
> npm install
> npm run dev
```

Now open your browser at `http://localhost:5173/`

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Usage

This is a [Remix.js](https://remix.run/) project bootstrapped with [`create-remix@latest`](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/blob/main/packages/create-remix) integrated with `helia`.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/routes/_index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
