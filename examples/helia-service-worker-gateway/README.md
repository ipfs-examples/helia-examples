## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.

### Installation and Running example

```console
> npm install
> npm start
```

Now open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

In this example, you will find a boilerplate you can use to guide yourself into bundling helia with webpack, so that you can use it in your own web app!

You should see the following:
